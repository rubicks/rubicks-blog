Getting [hakyll][hakyll], [travis-ci][travis-ci], and
[github-pages][github-pages] to work together isn't difficult, but not trivial,
either.

When using hakyll, the working process is simple enough:

```
$ emacs -nw ./stuff.md    # hack on templates and markdown files
$ ghc --make site.hs      # create ./site executable
$ ./site build            # create site artifacts in ./_site/
```

From there, getting the contents of ```./_site/``` into your github-pages repo
is usually left as an exercise to the reader.

Let's automate it. [Similar things][yap-deploys-pelican] have been done before.
