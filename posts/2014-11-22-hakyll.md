I got [hakyll](hakyll) working. Getting [hakyll](hakyll),
[travis-ci](travis-ci), and [github-pages](github-pages) to work together isn't
difficult, but not trivial, either.

When using hakyll, the working process is as follows:

```
$ emacs -nw ./stuff.md    # hack on templates and markdown files
$ ghc --make site.hs      # create ./site executable
$ ./site build            # create site artifacts in ./_site/
```

From there, getting the contents of ```./_site/``` into your github-pages repo
is usually left as an exercise to the reader.

Let's automate it. [Similar things](yap-deploys-pelican).
